	<h1><font size="7">My Favorite Musicians</font></h1>

<hr />

<ul>
	<li><h2>Josh Homme</h2></li>
	<img src="images/homme.jpg"/>
	<p>Born in Joshua Tree, California, the 42-year-old guitarist and singer is one of the most underrated musicians in the modern era of rock music. He is the genius behind Kyuss, a stoner rock band formed in 1987, Eagles of Death Metal, and alternative/hard rock band Queens Of The Stone Age (QOTSA). Homme is the only continuous founding member who is still a part of the group after a rotating list of musicians throughout a 20-year span. He is married to Brody Dalle, former lead singer/guitarist of esteemed punk group 'The Distillers'. His powerful, multi-range vocals, down-to-earth, broody demeanor, and unabashed honesty are a few of the reasons why I've like him since I was 13 years old.</p>

	<li><h3><font size="5">Lady Gaga</font></h3></li>

	<p>Native New Yorker Stefani Germanotta attended New York University's Tisch School of the Arts before dropping out to pursue a career in music. The 29-year-old started out as a songwriter for Sony Music before she was discovered by Akon, who subsequently helped "her sign a deal with Interscope records. In 2008, she released her first single "Just Dance" and has since added to her catalog of multi-platinum hits with five Grammy awards and a Golden Globe for her work in American Horror Story Hotel. She is engaged to 'Chicago Fire' star Taylor Kinney, and has two adorable french bulldogs named Asia and Koji.  Despite her esoteric fashion choices, her musical versatility and wide array of talent has made me a lifelong fan.</p>

	<li><h4><font size="5">Big K.R.I.T.</font></h4></li>

	<p>Though he isn't part of the mainstream wave of hip-hop, 29-year-old Justin Scott is a legend in the making. The Meridian, Mississippi native started his rap career in 2005, but it would be another five years before he gained critical acclaim with his mixtape <i>K.R.I.T. Wuz Here</i>. K.R.I.T., which stands for King Remembered In Time, has written and produced nearly all of his music except for a select few tracks. Through the years, he has collaborated with artists like Wiz Khalifa, Curren$y, and popular trap star Future. His conscious lyrics about the dynamics of romantic and familial relationships, social justice issues, down south culture, and candy-painted whips are a few reasons why the Southern MC is one of my favorites. </p>

	<li><h4><font size="5">Trent Reznor</font></h4></li>

	<p>The singer-songwriter and composer hails from New Castle, Pennsylvania. Most famous for heading Nine Inch Nails, the 50-year-old is considered to be a pioneer in the industrial rock genre of the late 1980s. Reznor has been playing piano since the age of five and showed musical prowess during his childhood. He has most recently gained critical success with film scoring, starting with 2010's <i>The Social Network</i>, for which he won an oscar. He has gone on to score box office hits such as <i>The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</i> and <i>Gone Girl</i>. Aside from being a great live performer, his strong conviction to the quality and subject matter of his work continues to make me a fan.</p>

	<li><h5><font size="5">Lana Del Rey</font></h5></li>

	<p>Seemingly plucked from the set of a 1960s film set, Elizabeth Woolridge Grant is a singer, songwriter, and model. The 30-year-old started her music career in 2005, but first gained mainstream attention with the music video for her single "Video Games", which was a viral internet sensation in 2011. Her major label debut <i>Born To Die</i> earned her a Grammy nomination for Best Pop Vocal Album the following year. Del Rey knows how to work her classic looks and voice to give her songs about tragic romance and pop culture references to 1950s and 1960s Americana life, making them instantly relatable for millenials. Her lounge-singer persona and timeless look make her a favorite of mine.</p>
